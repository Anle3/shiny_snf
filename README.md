A demo of a shiny app using the SNF algorithm
## Description  
 SNF is a novel computational method for genomic data integration that was developed in the lab of Anna Goldenberg. SNF constructs patient similarity networks for each of the data types and in a second step integrates iteratively these networks until it converges to a final fused network. SNF is able to deal with various data types and since the integration happens in the sample space one can combine various data type without worrying for different scales or noise among the different data.   
 This application allows even for users with no bioinformatics experience to familiarize and use the SNF method. The data available in this application are restricted to the Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) data set from the paper of Wang et al. Other implementations of this method within the eTRIKS project will allow users to upload their own data.
